# Neural-Networks
Journey Of Deep learning from Basics

In this repository I’ll share how I’ve been studying Deep Learning and using it to solve data science problems.
I will be uploading notebooks as I study and understand in the same order

Order as follows
 - NN-1
 - ML and DL
 - CNN FASHION MNIST
 - CIFAR 10
 - Autoregressive 
 - TF2.0 RNN Shapes- Implementing simpleRNN and hardcoding RNN
